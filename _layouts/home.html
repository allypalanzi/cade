    <h2>Screen Printing</h2>
    <p>My dream career. I am looking for an entry position at a shop in which I can work with a team of expereinced professionals. Whether that be pre-production or actually working with screens, I hope to get my foot in the door and learn the ins-and-outs of the craft through experience and whatever wisdom my teammates have to pass on. While I may not have worked in a print shop environment before I am confident my experience, attention to detail, and strong drive for quality will somthing something something. Motivation. Problem-solving.</p>

        <h1>Cade Robinson</h1>
        <p>Ever since I can remember I have been finding makeshift ways of applying my art onto different surfaces. From making stickers with address labels when I was 8 to hand-painting type onto t-shirts when I was 16. After recieving my BFA in Graphic Design it became clear that Washington DC was not the place for me to pursue my dream career in screen printing due to the lack of shops, let alone open positions. When my partner and I moved our butts accross the country in search of happiness and belonging, I came to appreciate Portland’s love of craftsmanship and close ties to traditional mediums.</p>

        <p>I spend most of my days with my partner who is a fellow graphic designer, Dobby the awkward dachshund, Swoon the sweet rat, and Knives the scrappy kitten.</p>
